One of the first projects I did with UE was a vehicle driving simulation, then I added the mechanics of switching with the fps character.

The game can be played both with mouse and keyboard and with gamepad. It contains all modern driving mechanics. Camera rotation, gearshift, handbrake etc. Level and environmental design are also made by mine.

All assets were purchased from the Unreal Engine Marketplace and Quixel Bridge.
